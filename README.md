### Project Vision (Please make this your first task as a team)

When students want to transfer from one institution to another, they want to know how their course history will transfer to equivalent course credit at the desired institution. This project creates a schema to capture the information about transfer equivalency: details about the course at the originating institution, details about the course at the destination institution, how many transfer credits a course is worth, a history of course transfer information, and other course details.

### Current Project Team Accomplishments
What did the Project Team get done during the Sprint?

### Project Team Accomplishments (YTD)
* In July 2019, the project team created a schema, some record types, and an outline of the setup guide.

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
See the [Issues](https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Philadelphia/transfer-equivalency/issues) tab for open enhancements. Feel free to add additional suggestions and use cases!

### Roadmap
Students will be able to see how their courses transfer to the destination institution. This database of transfer equivalencies is exposed to students so students can "window shop" to see how their existing credits could transfer to different institutions.
