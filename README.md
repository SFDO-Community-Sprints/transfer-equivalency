### Project Name
Transfer Equivalency for All

### Project Description
When students want to transfer from one instution to another, they want to know how their course history will transfer to equivalent course credit at the desired institution. This project creates a schema to capture the information about transfer equivalency: details about the course at the originating institution, details about the course at the destination institution, how many transfer credits a course is worth, and a history of equivalency attempts and successes.

### Project Audience
Institutions that receive requests for transfer credit from prospective students and applicants.

### Project Roadmap
Students will be able to see how their courses transfer to the destination institution. This database of transfer equivalencies is exposed to students so students can "window shop" to see how their existing credits could transfer to different institutions.
